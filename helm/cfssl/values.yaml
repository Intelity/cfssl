# This is a file with default chart values
#
# Tip:
#
# You must add here any values that required in templates.
# If you miss some of them, you will see an error after `helm lint charts/project-demo` command execution, such as:
#
# [ERROR] templates/: render error in "project-demo/templates/secret.yaml":
# template: project-demo/templates/secret.yaml:14:48: executing "project-demo/templates/secret.yaml" at <b64enc>

  cfssl: 1

# Do NOT set the image hash manually. Jenkins will do this for you.

# This is a dirty hack. Templates in Helm don't allow to directly set variables.
# A "Variable" it's just a link to some object.
# So we need to define this "object" and create "variable" that points to it.
# And this "variable" can be used then.
# Usage example:
# metadata:
# {{- $appName := index .Values "apps" "cfssl" }}
#   name: {{ $appName }}
apps:
  cfssl: cfssl
